                <h4>Prepare to enter Night City this November</h4>
                <p>
                    Cyberpunk 2077 has been delayed from September 17 to <time>November 19</time>, CD Projekt Red has
                    announced in a new statement on Twitter, seen below.
                    The official announcement from the Polish studio explains that "Cyberpunk 2077 is finished both
                    content and
                    gameplay-wise. The quests, the cutscenes, the skills and items; all the adventures Night City has to
                    offer - it's all
                    there."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "But with such an abundance of content and complex systems interweaving with each other, we need to
                    properly go through
                    everything, balance game mechanics, and fix a lot of bugs. " "Ready when it's done" is not just a
                    phrase we say because
                    it sounds right, it's something we live by even when we know we'll take the heat for it."
                </p>

                <p>
                    This news marks the second delay for the upcoming game of <time>2020</time>, though it's not quite
                    as significant
                    as the first, which
                    originally pushed it back by several months from its original release date of <time>April 16</time>.

                <h4>Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is arriving holiday 2020 on the PS5 - here are the latest rumours
                    and leaks.</h4>
                <p>
                    The PlayStation 5 is due to release sometime in Fall 2020, perhaps one game that could sway
                    consumers in the PS5 vs Xbox
                    Series X debate is the sequel to the very successful Spider-Man game that released on the PS4 in
                    2018 which sold over 9
                    million units worldwide.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With rumors circulating on Reddit since the announcement of the game, we still know little about the
                    game nevertheless.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some big changes are in store for the web-slinger as it's set to utilise all of the power coming
                    with the PS5.

                <h2>The Witcher 4: Geralt's gone for good, it's definitely coming and everything else we know so far
                </h2>

                <h4>Will there be a Witcher 4? We round up what the developer and the games suggest is in Geralt's
                    future.</h4>
                <p>
                    The Witcher 4 is coming at some point, and even though it probably won't eventually be called The
                    Witcher 4, we are
                    getting a new game in the series... at some point. Maybe year <time>2023</time>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Of course, we will be quite the way off any release date, mostly because developer CD Projekt Red is
                    really busy with
                    another little project known as Cyberpunk 2077 right now, but it's looking increasingly likely the
                    team's next project
                    is The Witcher 4.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Witcher 4 is inevitable. Whether it'll be eventually called The Witcher 4 or something else
                    entirely is another
                    question, but it will exist... eventually. Yes, we accept that it's probably quite the way off a
                    release date, mostly
                    because developer CD Projekt Red is really busy with another little project known as Cyberpunk 2077
                    right now, but it's
                    looking increasingly likely the team's next project is The Witcher 4.

                <h4>Why The PS5 Reveal Means That GTA 6 Isn't Coming For A Long Time</h4>

                <p>Don't expect it anytime soon.</p>

                <p>At last night's PlayStation 5 event, fans were waiting patiently for that first megaton announcement
                    - what would kick
                    off Sony's big coming-out party for their new console?</p>

                <p>We'll admit, we even allowed ourselves to be a little bit excited when we saw Rockstar's logo appear,
                    but we should've
                    known better. While we know that GTA 6 is in development we also shouldn't have expected a full
                    reveal.</p>
