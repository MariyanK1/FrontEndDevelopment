            An apple is an <b>edible</b> fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated
            worldwide and are
            the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild
            ancestor, Malus
            sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and
            were brought to
            North America by European colonists.

            Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including
            Norse, Greek and European Christian tradition.Apple trees are large if grown from seed. Generally, apple
            cultivars are propagated by grafting onto rootstocks, which control the size of the resulting tree. There
            are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in a range of
            desired characteristics.

            Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a
            number of
            organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease
            control and
            selective breeding in apple production.
            Worldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half
            of the total.
